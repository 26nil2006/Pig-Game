The Pig Game is a simple yet entertaining game where two players compete to reach a target score first. The rules are straightforward:

- 🎲 **Roll the Die:** Players take turns rolling a single die. The number rolled adds to their turn total.
- 🚫 **Rolling a 1:** If a player rolls a 1, they lose their turn, and their turn total resets to zero.
- ✋ **Hold:** Players can choose to hold, adding their turn total to their global score and passing the turn to the other player.
- 🏆 **Winning:** The first player to reach the target score of **100 points** wins the game!
