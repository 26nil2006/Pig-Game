# Pig - Game

This repository contains the implementation of the classic dice game, Pig Game. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an engaging and interactive user experience.

Game Rules:
The game is played between two players, taking turns to roll a single die.
On a player's turn, they can roll the die as many times as they like, adding the value of each roll to their turn total.
However, if the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and their turn total is lost.
Players can choose to "Hold" at any time, which adds their turn total to their global score, and passes the turn to the other player.
The first player to reach a predetermined score (e.g., 100) on their global score wins the game.
Features:
Responsive and user-friendly design.
Dynamic dice roll animations.
Player score tracking.
Option to reset the game at any time.
